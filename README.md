## Aaron Colon
Current Biostatistics and Health Data Science Major as well as a Pre-med track student at Lehigh University 
Past & Current Research conducted at Lehigh University under "PurpleDrop" A novel DNA storage device.
Past scientific experience through SEA-PHAGES, Mountaintop Summer Experience, and DNA30.
My long-term goal is to approach the biostatistics field through a job right out of undergraduate education. Alternatively, I hope also to attend higher education via medical school or graduate school if finances permit it.
